Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms,
 and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.
 It combines elements of statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to analyze and interpret complex data sets.
 By leveraging techniques such as machine learning, data mining, and predictive modeling,
 data scientists can uncover patterns and make informed decisions.
 The insights gained from data science are used across various industries, from healthcare to finance,
 to drive innovation and improve outcomes.
